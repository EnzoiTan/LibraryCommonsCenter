        <p class="desc-indent">
          Approximately nine decades ago, the Zamboanga City Polytechnic College
          had found its beginning in a small shop-work classroom of the
          Zamboanga Central School. That was in July, 1905. With the rise of its
          enrolment, it was converted into a provincial trade school, known as
          the Zamboanga Trade School, in 1921, becoming independent of its own
          in this particular year as it separated itself from its mother
          institution, the Zamboanga Central School. It is safe to say that
          alongside the founding of the institution is the establishment of the
          library, for without it the purpose of crafting the knowledge would be
          inadequate. The library is the crowning jewel of the institution that
          supports its academic formation and research development.
        </p>
        <p class="desc-indent">
          Through the efforts of the first and only Zamboangueno Senator,
          Roseller T. Lim, who sponsored a bill, the Republic Act. No. 846 was
          enacted into law in 1954 by the late Nationalist Leader of the
          Philippines, President Ramon F. Magsaysay. This law mandated the
          conversion of the city trade school into the Zamboanga City Regional
          School of Arts and Trades. This degree authorized the school to offer
          post-secondary courses in trade technical education. Mr. Marcelo
          Bonilla was its first superintendent. Narratives suggest that it was
          during this period that the library was formally established.
        </p>
        <p class="desc-indent">
          In 1992, the school enjoyed a milestone. Through a bill sponsored by
          Congresswoman Maria Clara L. Lobregat, Republic Act No. 7474 was
          effected. This law officially converted the name Zamboanga School of
          Arts and Trades to Zamboanga City Polytechnic College. The Library has
          expanded its collection and services on maritime education, industrial
          arts, and home economics that cater to the requirements needed for
          tertiary level.
        </p>
        <p class="desc-indent">
          In [1954] the library was situated on the 2nd floor of the old CAHSS
          Building (now the CICS Building). Mrs. Amerita, C. Abelon was the
          first librarian. Mrs. Henedina E. Fidel succeeded upon Mrs. Abelon's
          retirement.
        </p>
        <p class="desc-indent">
          In 2013, after the retirement of Mrs. Henedina E. Fidel, Mrs. Lourdes
          R. Alvarez was appointed as Head Librarian. During this period, the
          library relocated to CTE building and ballooned to 15,000 volumes of
          collection. After the retirement of Mrs. Alvarez in 2017, Dr. Nelson
          P. Cabral, the College President, appointed Mr. Carl Joseph C. Burlat
          as the new head librarian. In July 2019, the library relocated to its
          new location behind the CTE building. The library was later renamed
          into Learning Resource Center before it eventually settled to its
          present name, the Learning Commons Center under the supervision of Ms.
          Jenelee C. Pastor.
        </p>
        <p class="desc-indent">
          Today, the Learning Commons Center boosts a collection of almost
          20,000 volumes of books.
